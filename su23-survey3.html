  <b>2) Purpose and general description of the study</b>
      </p><p>
This is a research study being conducted by Professor Chris Murphy of Bryn Mawr College and Joseph Kim of Haverford College. 
        During the coronavirus pandemic, the dynamics of classrooms underwent drastic changes. 
        Traditional face-to-face class meetings transitioned to remote learning, requiring both instructors and students to adapt to this sudden shift while managing their personal circumstances. 
        Recognizing the challenges faced by students, instructors granted increased flexibility to help them manage their workload. 
        However, as the pandemic recedes and students return to in-person classes, a lingering question persists in both the classroom and institutional settings: to what extent should students be given flexibility? 
        This project seeks to understand the effect of different assignment deadline policies on students in CS courses. We expect this project to last for around two years.

<b>3) What does participation involve?</b>
       </p><p>
Participation involves completing an anonymous survey that should take around 10 minutes to complete. You’ll be asked about the different assignment deadline policies that you had in your CS courses, and be asked to evaluate them based on how they made you feel and how effective you felt they were. You’ll also be asked some optional demographic questions.

<b>4) Confidentiality, data storage, data deletion at end of research</b>
      </p><p>
To maintain your privacy and confidentiality, we will not collect any personal information about you other than some demographic information, and you do not have to tell us that information if you don’t want to. Also, we will not ask you any other information about your school (name, location, names of classes, names of professors, etc.), and if you do provide that to us in your responses, we’ll be sure to remove it from our data storage so that it is not recorded. We expect to store the data for two years from the time of collection, at which time it will be deleted.
<p>
The data is being collected using a secure (encrypted) connection to the host survey service provider. 
  Results are stored in a password protected account accessible by only the researchers and system administrators. 
  While no absolute guarantees can be made regarding security, these measures provide safeguards against outside agents accessing the electronic data.

<b>5) Risks of participating in the study</b>
      </p><p>
We recognize that reflecting on your experiences in prior CS courses may cause some discomfort, e.g. anxiety, sadness, frustration, etc. You will not need to describe any negative experiences. If you have any discomfort after completing the survey, you can contact us and we’ll be happy to work with you to find someone to help.</p>

<b>6) Benefits to participants or others</b>
      </p><p>
Although there are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research in terms of compensation, you may find it interesting and rewarding to reflect on and describe your experiences. Perhaps more importantly, though, as the goal of this research is to determine ways in which CS instructors can create more welcoming environments, you will be helping other students by sharing your insights and experiences, so that instructors can make more informed decisions about assignment deadline policies and better support their students as a result.</p>

<b>9) Voluntary participation</b>
      </p><p>
Your participation is completely voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time. If you choose not to participate, there will be no penalty or loss of any benefits for not participating, and there will be no effect on your grade in any class.</p>
