  <h2>2) Purpose and General Description of the Study</h2>
This is a research study being conducted by Professor Chris Murphy and Jie Ji of Bryn Mawr College. 
  As the global mental health crisis worsens, particularly among undergraduate students, we are focusing on understanding the experiences of students in rigorous, competitive fields such as Computer Science so that they can be better supported by their instructors. 
  The purpose of this research is to answer the following questions: What are the experiences of undergraduate Computer Science students who are living with mental health conditions? What challenges do they face in studying Computer Science? What can Computer Science instructors do to foster inclusive spaces for these students, so that they can learn more and feel more welcome? 
  We expect this project to last for around two years.

<h2>3) What does participation involve?</h2>
If you are participating in this study by completing the survey, you can access the survey using the link below. 
This link is the same for all participants, so that your responses will be anonymous. 
If you would prefer to be interviewed, please contact a member of the research team using the email addresses below. 
We expect that the time to complete the survey should be around 10-15 minutes.
</p>
<p>
All survey questions are optional. 
  We will ask you to self-describe your mental health status, and then we’ll ask you questions about your experiences as a Computer Science student, like what your professors have done to make you feel welcome and included, and what other things they can do to better support you.
</p>
<p>
We know that discussing mental health can be challenging, and we won’t ask you anything about that except to self-describe your status in your own terms. 
  While answering the other questions, you’ll always have the opportunity to take a break, or to stop answering the questions if you’d like.
</p>

<p>
<h2>4) Confidentiality, Data Storage, Data Deletion at end of Research</h2>
To maintain your privacy and confidentiality, we will not collect any personal information about you other than the type of school you attend, and you do not have to tell us that information if you don’t want to. 
Also, we will not ask you any other information about your school (name, location, names of classes, names of professors, etc.), and if you do provide that to us in your responses, we’ll be sure to remove it from our data storage so that it is not recorded. 
We expect to store the data for two years from the time of collection, at which time it will be deleted.
</p>
<p>
The data is being collected using a secure (encrypted) connection to the host survey service provider. 
  Results are stored in a password protected account accessible by only the researchers and system administrators. 
  While no absolute guarantees can be made regarding security, these measures provide safeguards against outside agents accessing the electronic data.
</p>

<p>
<h2>5) Risks of participating in the study</h2>
We recognize that discussing your experiences may cause some discomfort, e.g. anxiety, sadness, frustration, etc. 
All questions are optional, so that you can skip anything you don’t want to discuss. 
If you need a break, that’s totally fine, and you can stop at any time if you don’t want to continue. 
If you still have any discomfort after we’re done, you can contact us and we’ll be happy to work with you to find someone to help.
</p>

<p>
<h2>6) Benefits to participants or others</h2>
Although there are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research in terms of compensation, you may find it interesting and rewarding to reflect on and describe your experiences. 
Perhaps more importantly, though, as the goal of this research is to determine ways in which CS instructors can create more welcoming environments, you will be helping other students by sharing your insights and experiences, so that instructors can better support their students as a result.
</p>

<p>
<h2>7) Compensation </h2>
There will be no compensation for participating in this research.
</p>

<p>
<h2>8) Deception</h2>
There is no deception used in this study.
</p>

<p>
<h2>9) Voluntary participation</h2>
Your participation is completely voluntary. 
You can withdraw from the study at any time. You do not have to answer any questions that you don't want to answer. 
If you choose not to participate, there will be no penalty or loss of any benefits for not participating, and there will be no effect on your grade in any class.
</p>

<p>
<h2>10) Questions about the research and rights of research participants</h2>
If you should have any questions about the research, please feel free to call or email the Principal Investigator, Professor Chris Murphy (cmurphy1@brynmawr.edu). 
If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, please contact the Chair of the Bryn Mawr College IRB (irb@brynmawr.edu).
